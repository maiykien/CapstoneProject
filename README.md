Introduction to Bike-Share
Welcome to the Cyclist bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you will work for a fictional company, Cyclist, along with some key team members. To answer the business questions, we will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will assist you in staying on the right path.

Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team aims to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. However, Cyclistic executives must first approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Preparation
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
