## Introduction about Bike-Share
Welcome to the Cyclist bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you work for a fictional company, Cyclist, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help you stay on the right path.

## Scenario
I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share. You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Preparation
1. Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
